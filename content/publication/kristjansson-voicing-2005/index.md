abstract: 'Accurate speech activity detection is a challenging problem in the car
  environment where high background noise and high amplitude transient sounds are
  common. We investigate a number of features that are designed for capturing the
  harmonic structure of speech. We evaluate separately three important characteristics
  of these features: 1) discriminative power 2) robustness to greatly varying SNR
  and channel characteristics and 3) performance when used in conjunction with MFCC
  features. We propose a new features, the Windowed Autocorrelation Lag Energy (WALE)
  which has desirable properties.'

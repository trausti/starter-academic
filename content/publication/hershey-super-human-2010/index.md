abstract: We present a system that can separate and recognize the simultaneous speech
  of two people recorded in a single channel. Applied to the monaural speech separation
  and recognition challenge, the system out-performed all other participants – including
  human listeners – with an overall recognition error rate of 21.6%, compared to the
  human error rate of 22.3%. The system consists of a speaker recognizer, a model-based
  speech separation module, and a speech recognizer. For the separation models we
  explored a range of speech models that incorporate diﬀerent levels of constraints
  on temporal dynamics to help infer the source speech signals. The system achieves
  its best performance when the model of temporal dynamics closely captures the grammatical
  constraints of the task. For inference, we compare a 2-D Viterbi algorithm and two
  loopy belief-propagation algorithms. We show how belief-propagation reduces the
  complexity of temporal inference from exponential to linear in the number of sources
  and the size of the language model. The best belief-propagation method results in
  nearly the same recognition error rate as exact inference.

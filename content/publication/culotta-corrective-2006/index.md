abstract: 'To successfully embed statistical machine learning models in real world
  applications, two post-deployment capabilities must be provided: (1) the ability
  to solicit user corrections and (2) the ability to update the model from these corrections.
  We refer to the former capability as corrective feedback and the latter as persistent
  learning. While these capabilities have a natural implementation for simple classiﬁcation
  tasks such as spam ﬁltering, we argue that a more careful design is required for
  structured classiﬁcation tasks.'

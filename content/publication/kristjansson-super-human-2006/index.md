abstract: We describe a system for model based speech separation which achieves super-human
  recognition performance when two talkers speak at similar levels. The system can
  separate the speech of two speakers from a single channel recording with remarkable
  results. It incorporates a novel method for performing two-talker speaker identiﬁcation
  and gain estimation. We extend the method of model based high resolution signal
  reconstruction to incorporate temporal dynamics. We report on two methods for introducing
  dynamics; the ﬁrst uses dynamics in the acoustic model space, the second incorporates
  dynamics based on sentence grammar. The addition of temporal constraints leads to
  dramatic improvements in the separation performance. Once the signals have been
  separated they are then recognized using speaker dependent labeling.

 abstract = {A variational inference algorithm for robust speech separation, capable of recovering the underlying speech sources even in the case of more sources than microphone observations, is presented. The algorithm is based upon an generative probabilistic model that fuses time-delay of arrival (TDOA) information with prior information about the speakers and application, to produce an optimal estimate of the underlying speech sources. Simulation results are presented for the case of two, three and four underlying sources and two microphones observations corrupted by noise. The resulting SNR gains (24dB with two sources, 15dB with three sources, and 9dB with four sources) are signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than previous speech separation techniques.},

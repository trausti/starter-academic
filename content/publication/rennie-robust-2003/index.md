abstract: A variational inference algorithm for robust speech separation, capable
  of recovering the underlying speech sources even in the case of more sources than
  microphone observations, is presented. The algorithm is based upon an generative
  probabilistic model that fuses time-delay of arrival (TDOA) information with prior
  information about the speakers and application, to produce an optimal estimate of
  the underlying speech sources. Simulation results are presented for the case of
  two, three and four underlying sources and two microphones observations corrupted
  by noise. The resulting SNR gains (24dB with two sources, 15dB with three sources,
  and 9dB with four sources) are signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than previous speech separation
  techniques.

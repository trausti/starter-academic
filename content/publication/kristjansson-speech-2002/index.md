abstract: AbstractIn this thesis I advocate a probabilistic view of robust speech
  recognition.  I discuss theclassification of distorted features using an optimal
  classifier, and I show how the gener-ation of noisy speech can be represented as
  a generative graphical probability model. Bydoing so, my aim is to build a conceptual
  framework that provides a unified understand-ing of robust speech recognition, and
  to some extent bridges the gap between a purelysignal processing viewpoint and the
  pattern classification or decoding viewpoint.The most  tangible  contribution  of  this  thesis  is
  the  introduction  of  the  Algonquinmethod for robust speech recognition.  It exemplifies
  the probabilistic method and en-compasses a number of novel ideas.  For example,
  it uses a probability distribution todescribe the relationship between clean speech,
  noise, channel and the resultant noisyspeech. It employs a variational approach
  tofind an approximation to the joint posteriordistribution which can be used for
  the purpose of restoring the distorted observations. Italso allows us to estimate
  the parameters of the environment using a Generalized EMmethod.Another important
  contribution of this thesis is a new paradigm for robust speechrecognition, which
  we calluncertainty decoding.  This new paradigm follows naturallyfrom the standard
  way of performing inference in the graphical probability model thatdescribes noisy
  speech generation.

 abstract = {AbstractIn this thesis I advocate a probabilistic view of robust speech recognition.  I discuss theclassification of distorted features using an optimal classifier, and I show how the gener-ation of noisy speech can be represented as a generative graphical probability model. Bydoing so, my aim is to build a conceptual framework that provides a unified understand-ing of robust speech recognition, and to some extent bridges the gap between a purelysignal processing viewpoint and the pattern classification or decoding viewpoint.The most  tangible  contribution  of  this  thesis  is the  introduction  of  the  Algonquinmethod for robust speech recognition.  It exemplifies the probabilistic method and en-compasses a number of novel ideas.  For example, it uses a probability distribution todescribe the relationship between clean speech, noise, channel and the resultant noisyspeech. It employs a variational approach tofind an approximation to the joint posteriordistribution which can be used for the purpose of restoring the distorted observations. Italso allows us to estimate the parameters of the environment using a Generalized EMmethod.Another important contribution of this thesis is a new paradigm for robust speechrecognition, which we calluncertainty decoding.  This new paradigm follows naturallyfrom the standard way of performing inference in the graphical probability model thatdescribes noisy speech generation.},

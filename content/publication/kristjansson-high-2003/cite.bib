 abstract = {We present a framework for speech enhancement and robust speech recognition that exploits the harmonic structure of speech. We achieve substantial gains in signal to noise ratio (SNR) of enhanced speech as well as considerable gains in accuracy of automatic speech recognition in very noisy conditions.},

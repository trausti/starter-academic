abstract: We present a framework for speech enhancement and robust speech recognition
  that exploits the harmonic structure of speech. We achieve substantial gains in
  signal to noise ratio (SNR) of enhanced speech as well as considerable gains in
  accuracy of automatic speech recognition in very noisy conditions.

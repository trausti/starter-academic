abstract: Information Extraction methods can be used to automatically “ﬁll-in” database
  forms from unstructured data such as Web documents or email. State-of-the-art methods
  have achieved low error rates but invariably make a number of errors. The goal of
  an interactive information extraction system is to assist the user in ﬁlling in
  database ﬁelds while giving the user conﬁdence in the integrity of the data. The
  user is presented with an interactive interface that allows both the rapid veriﬁcation
  of automatic ﬁeld assignments and the correction of errors. In cases where there
  are multiple errors, our system takes into account user corrections, and immediately
  propagates these constraints such that other ﬁelds are often corrected automatically.

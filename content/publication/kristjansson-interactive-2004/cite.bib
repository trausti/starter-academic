 abstract = {Information Extraction methods can be used to automatically “ﬁll-in” database forms from unstructured data such as Web documents or email. State-of-the-art methods have achieved low error rates but invariably make a number of errors. The goal of an interactive information extraction system is to assist the user in ﬁlling in database ﬁelds while giving the user conﬁdence in the integrity of the data. The user is presented with an interactive interface that allows both the rapid veriﬁcation of automatic ﬁeld assignments and the correction of errors. In cases where there are multiple errors, our system takes into account user corrections, and immediately propagates these constraints such that other ﬁelds are often corrected automatically.},

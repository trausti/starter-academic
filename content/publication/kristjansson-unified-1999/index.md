abstract: A variety of media involve the spoken interaction of people. For this media
  to be useful, indexing and browsing facilities must be provided to the user. In
  this paper we present a uniﬁed framework for indexing and gisting spoken interactions
  of people. We use speaker identiﬁcation, prosody analysis and word spotting as preprocessing
  steps to ﬁnd the structure of the meeting. The structure is modeled using a stochastic
  approach based on the Hidden Markov Model. The result of the analysis is an outline
  or table of content, as well as a rich set of visual queues for navigating the media.
  In addition to the automatic analysis, we provide the user with tools for browsing
  the meeting, as well as tools for directing the analysis and editing the results.
  We present early results using the proposed framework.

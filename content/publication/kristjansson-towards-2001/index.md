abstract: Recognition rates of speech recognition systems are known to degrade substantially
  when there is a mismatch between training and deployment environments. One approach
  to tackling this problem is to transform the acoustic models based on the channel
  distortion and noise characteristics of the new environment. Currently, most model
  adaptation strategies assume that the noise characteristics are stationary. We present
  results for using multiple noise distributions for the Whisper large vocabulary
  speech recognition system. The Vector Taylor Series method for adaptation of the
  distributions is used, and either a weighted average of the noise states or the
  locally best noise states is used. Our results indicate that for certain types of
  noise, signiÔ¨Åcant gains in recognition accuracy can be achieved.

abstract: We describe a system that can separate and recognize the simultaneous speech
  of two speakers from a single channel recording and compare the performance of the
  system to that of human subjects. The system, which we call Iroquois, uses models
  of dynamics to achieve performance near that of human listeners, when averaged across
  all conditions. However the system exhibits a pattern of performance across conditions
  that is different from that of human subjects. In conditions where the amplitude
  of the speakers is similar, our surpasses human performance by over 50%. We hypothesize
  that the system accomplishes this remarkable feat by employing a different strategy
  to that of the human auditory system.

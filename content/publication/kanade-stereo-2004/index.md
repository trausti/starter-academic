abstract: We present a generative probabilistic model for 3D scenes with stereo views.
  With this model, we track an object in 3 dimensions while simultaneously learning
  its appearance and the appearance of the background. By using a generative model
  for the scene, we are able to aggregate evidence over time. In addition, the probabilistic
  model naturally handles sources of variability.

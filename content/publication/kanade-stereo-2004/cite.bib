 abstract = {We present a generative probabilistic model for 3D scenes with stereo views. With this model, we track an object in 3 dimensions while simultaneously learning its appearance and the appearance of the background. By using a generative model for the scene, we are able to aggregate evidence over time. In addition, the probabilistic model naturally handles sources of variability.},

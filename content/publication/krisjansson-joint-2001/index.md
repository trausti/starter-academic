abstract: The performance of speech cleaning and noise adaptation algorithms is heavily
  dependent on the quality of the noise and channel models. Various strategies have
  been proposed in the literature for adapting to the current noise and channel conditions.
  In this paper, we describe the joint learning of noise and channel distortion in
  a novel framework called ALGONQUIN. The learning algorithm employs a generalized
  EM strategy wherein the E step is approximate. We discuss the characteristics of
  the new algorithm, with a focus on convergence rates and parameter initialization.
  We show that the learning algorithm can successfully disentangle the non-linear
  effects of noise and linear effects of the channel and achieve a relative reduction
  in WER of 21.8% over the non-adaptive algorithm.

abstract: 'We present a probabilistic framework that uses a bone sensor and air microphone
  to perform speech enhancement for robust speech recognition. The system exploits
  advantages of both sensors: the noise resistance of the bone sensor, and the linearity
  of the air microphone. In this paper we describe the general properties of the bone
  sensor relative to conventional air sensors. We propose a model capable of adapting
  to the noise conditions, and evaluate performance using a commercial speech recognition
  system. We demonstrate considerable improvements in recognition – from a baseline
  of 57% up to nearly 80% word accuracy – for four subjects on a difﬁcult condition
  with background speaker interference.'

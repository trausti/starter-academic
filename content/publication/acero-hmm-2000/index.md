abstract: In this paper we address the problem of robustness of speech recognition
  systems in noisy environments. The goal is to estimate the parameters of a HMM that
  is matched to a noisy environment, given a HMM trained with clean speech and knowledge
  of the acoustical environment. We propose a method based on truncated vector Taylor
  series that approximates the performance of a system trained with that corrupted
  speech. We also provide insight on the approximations used in the model of the environment
  and compare them with the lognormal approximation in PMC.

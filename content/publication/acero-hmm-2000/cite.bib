 abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of robustness of speech recognition systems in noisy environments. The goal is to estimate the parameters of a HMM that is matched to a noisy environment, given a HMM trained with clean speech and knowledge of the acoustical environment. We propose a method based on truncated vector Taylor series that approximates the performance of a system trained with that corrupted speech. We also provide insight on the approximations used in the model of the environment and compare them with the lognormal approximation in PMC.},

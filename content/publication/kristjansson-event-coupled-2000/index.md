abstract: Inferences from time-series data can be greatly enhanced by taking into
  account multiple modalities. In some cases, such as audio of speech and the corresponding
  video of lip gestures, the different time-series are tightly coupled. We are interested
  in loosely-coupled time series where only the onset of events are coupled in time.
  We present an extension of the forward-backward algorithm that can be used for inference
  and learning in event-coupled hidden Markov models and give results on a simpliÔ¨Åed
  multi-media indexing task where the objective is to detect an event whose onset
  is loosely coupled in audio and video.

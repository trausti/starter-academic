abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition that
  directly incorporates information about the uncertainty introduced by environmental
  noise. In contrast to the feature cleaning and model adaptation paradigms, where
  the noise compensation mechanism is separate from the recognizer, the new paradigm
  uniÔ¨Åes the noise compensation mechanism and the recognizer. The Algonquin framework
  serves to demonstrate the importance of retaining soft information, i.e. information
  about the degree of uncertainty in the observations. The Algonquin framework employs
  Gaussian mixture models to model both noise and speech. Uncertainty introduced by
  the noise process is captured by the variance of the noise model. The Algonquin
  framework also allows us to isolate the effect of retaining or discarding soft information.
  Our initial results indicate that substantial improvements in recognition rates
  can be achieved through the use of soft information.

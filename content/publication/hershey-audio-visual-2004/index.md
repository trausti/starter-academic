abstract: Perceiving sounds in a noisy environment is a challenging problem. Visual
  lip-reading can provide relevant information but is also challenging because lips
  are moving and a tracker must deal with a variety of conditions. Typically audio-visual
  systems have been assembled from individually engineered modules. We propose to
  fuse audio and video in a probabilistic generative model that implements cross-model
  self-supervised learning, enabling adaptation to audio-visual data. The video model
  features a Gaussian mixture model embedded in a linear subspace of a sprite which
  translates in the video. The system can learn to detect and enhance speech in noise
  given only a short (30 second) sequence of audio-visual data. We show some results
  for speech detection and enhancement, and discuss extensions to the model that are
  under investigation.

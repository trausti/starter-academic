abstract: One approach to achieving noise and distortion robust speech recognition
  is to remove noise and distortion with algorithms of low complexity prior to the
  use of much higher complexity speech recognizers. This approach has been referred
  to as cleaning. In this paper we present an approach for speech cleaning using a
  time-varying, non-linear probabilistic model of a signals log Mel-ﬁlter-bank representation.
  We then present a new non-linear probabilistic inference technique and show results
  using this technique within the probabilistic cleaning model. In this approach we
  represent distributions for underlying noise, speech and channel characteristics
  as Gaussian mixtures and use Gaussian basis functions to model the non-linear likelihood
  function. This allows us to efﬁciently compute complex multi-modal probability distributions
  over speech and noise components of the underlying signal. We show how this method
  can be used to clean speech features and present results using the Aurora 2 speech
  recognizer trained on clean speech data. We present competitive initial results
  from a minimum mean square error version of this approach for a subset of the Aurora
  2 noisy digits recognition tasks.

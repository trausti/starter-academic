abstract: We introduce a novel acoustic echo cancellation framework for systems where
  the loudspeaker and the microphone array are not synchronized. We consider the problem
  in the most general form where the loss of synchronization is time-varying. The
  proposed system is linear and it utilizes microphone array beamforming for echo
  cancellation. It is shown to provide significant improvement over standard echo
  cancellation and noise suppression techniques in both noise suppression and speech
  recognition.

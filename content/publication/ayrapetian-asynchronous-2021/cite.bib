 abstract = {We introduce a novel acoustic echo cancellation framework for systems where the loudspeaker and the microphone array are not synchronized. We consider the problem in the most general form where the loss of synchronization is time-varying. The proposed system is linear and it utilizes microphone array beamforming for echo cancellation. It is shown to provide significant improvement over standard echo cancellation and noise suppression techniques in both noise suppression and speech recognition.},
